## In the hot path

Creating memories during runtime offers both advantages and challenges. On the positive side, this approach allows for real-time updates, making new memories immediately available for use in subsequent interactions. It also enables transparency, as users can be notified when memories are created and stored.

However, this method also presents challenges. It may increase complexity if the agent requires a new tool to decide what to commit to memory. In addition, the process of reasoning about what to save to memory can impact agent latency. Finally, the agent must multitask between memory creation and its other responsibilities, potentially affecting the quantity and quality of memories created.

As an example, ChatGPT uses a [save_memories](https://openai.com/index/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/) tool to upsert memories as content strings, deciding whether and how to use this tool with each user message. See our [memory-agent](https://github.com/langchain-ai/memory-agent) template as an reference implementation.
