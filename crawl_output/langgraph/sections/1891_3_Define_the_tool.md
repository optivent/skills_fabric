## 3. Define the tool

Define the web search tool:

:::python

```python
from langchain_tavily import TavilySearch

tool = TavilySearch(max_results=2)
tools = [tool]
tool.invoke("What's a 'node' in LangGraph?")
```

:::

:::js

```typescript
import { TavilySearch } from "@langchain/tavily";

const tool = new TavilySearch({ maxResults: 2 });
const tools = [tool];

await tool.invoke({ query: "What's a 'node' in LangGraph?" });
```

:::

The results are page summaries our chat bot can use to answer questions:

:::python

By managing the flow of data and the sequence of operations, LangGraph allows developers to focus on the high-level logic of their applications rather than the intricacies of agent coordination. Whether you need a chatbot that can handle various types of user requests or a multi-agent system that performs complex tasks, LangGraph provides the tools to build exactly what you need. LangGraph significantly simplifies the development of complex LLM applications by providing a structured framework for managing state and coordinating agent interactions.',

This state is updated by nodes in the graph, which return operations to attributes of this state (in the form of a key-value store). After adding nodes, you can then add edges to create the graph. An example of this may be in the basic agent runtime, where we always want the model to be called after we call a tool. The state of this graph by default contains concepts that should be familiar to you if you've used LangChain agents: `input`, `chat_history`, `intermediate_steps` (and `agent_outcome` to represent the most recent agent outcome)",
