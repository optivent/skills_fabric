## Communication

All runs in a LangGraph Server are executed by a pool of background workers that are part of each deployment. In order to enable some features for those runs (such as cancellation and output streaming) we need a channel for two-way communication between the server and the worker handling a particular run. We use Redis to organize that communication.

1. A Redis list is used as a mechanism to wake up a worker as soon as a new run is created. Only a sentinel value is stored in this list, no actual run information. The run information is then retrieved from Postgres by the worker.
2. A combination of a Redis string and Redis PubSub channel is used for the server to communicate a run cancellation request to the appropriate worker.
3. A Redis PubSub channel is used by the worker to broadcast streaming output from an agent while the run is being handled. Any open `/stream` request in the server will subscribe to that channel and forward any events to the response as they arrive. No events are stored in Redis at any time.
