## Multi-agent

A single agent might struggle if it needs to specialize in multiple domains or manage many tools. To tackle this, you can break your agent into smaller, independent agents and compose them into a [multi-agent system](../concepts/multi_agent.md).

In multi-agent systems, agents need to communicate between each other. They do so via [handoffs](#handoffs) — a primitive that describes which agent to hand control to and the payload to send to that agent.

Two of the most popular multi-agent architectures are:

- [supervisor](#supervisor) — individual agents are coordinated by a central supervisor agent. The supervisor controls all communication flow and task delegation, making decisions about which agent to invoke based on the current context and task requirements.
- [swarm](#swarm) — agents dynamically hand off control to one another based on their specializations. The system remembers which agent was last active, ensuring that on subsequent interactions, the conversation resumes with that agent.
