## Navigating to a node in a parent graph

:::python
If you are using [subgraphs](./subgraphs.md), you might want to navigate from a node within a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify `graph=Command.PARENT` in `Command`:

```python
def my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal["other_subgraph"]]:
    return Command(
        update={"foo": "bar"},
        goto="other_subgraph",  # where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph
        graph=Command.PARENT
    )
```

!!! note

    Setting `graph` to `Command.PARENT` will navigate to the closest parent graph.

!!! important "State updates with `Command.PARENT`"

    When you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that's shared by both parent and subgraph [state schemas](#schema), you **must** define a [reducer](#reducers) for the key you're updating in the parent graph state. See this [example](../how-tos/graph-api.md#navigate-to-a-node-in-a-parent-graph).

This is particularly useful when implementing [multi-agent handoffs](./multi_agent.md#handoffs).
