## Using Messages in your Graph

:::python
In many cases, it is helpful to store prior conversation history as a list of messages in your graph state. To do so, we can add a key (channel) to the graph state that stores a list of `Message` objects and annotate it with a reducer function (see `messages` key in the example below). The reducer function is vital to telling the graph how to update the list of `Message` objects in the state with each state update (for example, when a node sends an update). If you don't specify a reducer, every state update will overwrite the list of messages with the most recently provided value. If you wanted to simply append messages to the existing list, you could use `operator.add` as a reducer.

However, you might also want to manually update messages in your graph state (e.g. human-in-the-loop). If you were to use `operator.add`, the manual state updates you send to the graph would be appended to the existing list of messages, instead of updating existing messages. To avoid that, you need a reducer that can keep track of message IDs and overwrite existing messages, if updated. To achieve this, you can use the prebuilt `add_messages` function. For brand new messages, it will simply append to existing list, but it will also handle the updates for existing messages correctly.

If you wanted to simply append messages to the existing list, you could use a function that concatenates arrays as a reducer.

However, you might also want to manually update messages in your graph state (e.g. human-in-the-loop). If you were to use a simple concatenation function, the manual state updates you send to the graph would be appended to the existing list of messages, instead of updating existing messages. To avoid that, you need a reducer that can keep track of message IDs and overwrite existing messages, if updated. To achieve this, you can use the prebuilt `MessagesZodState` schema. For brand new messages, it will simply append to existing list, but it will also handle the updates for existing messages correctly.
