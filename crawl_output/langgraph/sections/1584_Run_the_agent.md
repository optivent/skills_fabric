## Run the agent

agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "look up user information"}]},
    # highlight-next-line
    config={"configurable": {"user_id": "user_123"}}
)
```

1. The `InMemoryStore` is a store that stores data in memory. In a production setting, you would typically use a database or other persistent storage. Please review the [store documentation](../../reference/store.md) for more options. If you're deploying with **LangGraph Platform**, the platform will provide a production-ready store for you.
2. For this example, we write some sample data to the store using the `put` method. Please see the @[BaseStore.put] API reference for more details.
3. The first argument is the namespace. This is used to group related data together. In this case, we are using the `users` namespace to group user data.
4. A key within the namespace. This example uses a user ID for the key.
5. The data that we want to store for the given user.
6. The `get_store` function is used to access the store. You can call it from anywhere in your code, including tools and prompts. This function returns the store that was passed to the agent when it was created.
7. The `get` method is used to retrieve data from the store. The first argument is the namespace, and the second argument is the key. This will return a `StoreValue` object, which contains the value and metadata about the value.
8. The `store` is passed to the agent. This enables the agent to access the store when running tools. You can also use the `get_store` function to access the store from anywhere in your code.
