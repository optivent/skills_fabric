## Example

Below we demonstrate a simple application that writes an essay and [interrupts](human_in_the_loop.md) to request human review.

:::python

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.types import interrupt

@task
def write_essay(topic: str) -> str:
    """Write an essay about the given topic."""
    time.sleep(1) # A placeholder for a long-running task.
    return f"An essay about topic: {topic}"

@entrypoint(checkpointer=InMemorySaver())
def workflow(topic: str) -> dict:
    """A simple workflow that writes an essay and asks for a review."""
    essay = write_essay("cat").result()
    is_approved = interrupt({
        # Any json-serializable payload provided to interrupt as argument.
        # It will be surfaced on the client side as an Interrupt when streaming data
        # from the workflow.
        "essay": essay, # The essay we want reviewed.
        # We can add any additional information that we need.
        # For example, introduce a key called "action" with some instructions.
        "action": "Please approve/reject the essay",
    })

    return {
        "essay": essay, # The essay that was generated
        "is_approved": is_approved, # Response from HIL
    }
```

:::js

```typescript
import { MemorySaver, entrypoint, task, interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const writeEssay = task("writeEssay", async (topic: string) => {
  // A placeholder for a long-running task.
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  return `An essay about topic: ${topic}`;
});

const workflow = entrypoint(
  { checkpointer: new MemorySaver(), name: "workflow" },
  async (topic: string) => {
    const essay = await writeEssay(topic);
    const isApproved = interrupt({
      // Any json-serializable payload provided to interrupt as argument.
      // It will be surfaced on the client side as an Interrupt when streaming data
      // from the workflow.
      essay, // The essay we want reviewed.
      // We can add any additional information that we need.
      // For example, introduce a key called "action" with some instructions.
      action: "Please approve/reject the essay",
    });

    return {
      essay, // The essay that was generated
      isApproved, // Response from HIL
    };
  }
);
```

??? example "Detailed Explanation"

    This workflow will write an essay about the topic "cat" and then pause to get a review from a human. The workflow can be interrupted for an indefinite amount of time until a review is provided.

    When the workflow is resumed, it executes from the very start, but because the result of the `writeEssay` task was already saved, the task result will be loaded from the checkpoint instead of being recomputed.

    :::python
    ```python
    import time
    import uuid
    from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
    from langgraph.types import interrupt
    from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver


    @task
    def write_essay(topic: str) -> str:
        """Write an essay about the given topic."""
        time.sleep(1)  # This is a placeholder for a long-running task.
        return f"An essay about topic: {topic}"

    @entrypoint(checkpointer=InMemorySaver())
    def workflow(topic: str) -> dict:
        """A simple workflow that writes an essay and asks for a review."""
        essay = write_essay("cat").result()
        is_approved = interrupt(
            {
                # Any json-serializable payload provided to interrupt as argument.
                # It will be surfaced on the client side as an Interrupt when streaming data
                # from the workflow.
                "essay": essay,  # The essay we want reviewed.
                # We can add any additional information that we need.
                # For example, introduce a key called "action" with some instructions.
                "action": "Please approve/reject the essay",
            }
        )
        return {
            "essay": essay,  # The essay that was generated
            "is_approved": is_approved,  # Response from HIL
        }


    thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": thread_id}}
    for item in workflow.stream("cat", config):
        print(item)
    # > {'write_essay': 'An essay about topic: cat'}
    # > {
    # >     '__interrupt__': (
    # >        Interrupt(
    # >            value={
    # >                'essay': 'An essay about topic: cat',
    # >                'action': 'Please approve/reject the essay'
    # >            },
    # >            id='b9b2b9d788f482663ced6dc755c9e981'
    # >        ),
    # >    )
    # > }
    ```

    An essay has been written and is ready for review. Once the review is provided, we can resume the workflow:

    ```python
    from langgraph.types import Command

    # Get review from a user (e.g., via a UI)
    # In this case, we're using a bool, but this can be any json-serializable value.
    human_review = True

    for item in workflow.stream(Command(resume=human_review), config):
        print(item)
    ```

    ```pycon
    {'workflow': {'essay': 'An essay about topic: cat', 'is_approved': False}}
    ```

    The workflow has been completed and the review has been added to the essay.
