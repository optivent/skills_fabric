## Procedural memory

[Procedural memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_memory), in both humans and AI agents, involves remembering the rules used to perform tasks. In humans, procedural memory is like the internalized knowledge of how to perform tasks, such as riding a bike via basic motor skills and balance. Episodic memory, on the other hand, involves recalling specific experiences, such as the first time you successfully rode a bike without training wheels or a memorable bike ride through a scenic route. For AI agents, procedural memory is a combination of model weights, agent code, and agent's prompt that collectively determine the agent's functionality. 

In practice, it is fairly uncommon for agents to modify their model weights or rewrite their code. However, it is more common for agents to modify their own prompts. 

One effective approach to refining an agent's instructions is through ["Reflection"](https://blog.langchain.dev/reflection-agents/) or meta-prompting. This involves prompting the agent with its current instructions (e.g., the system prompt) along with recent conversations or explicit user feedback. The agent then refines its own instructions based on this input. This method is particularly useful for tasks where instructions are challenging to specify upfront, as it allows the agent to learn and adapt from its interactions.

For example, we built a [Tweet generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn8A3BxfplE) using external feedback and prompt re-writing to produce high-quality paper summaries for Twitter. In this case, the specific summarization prompt was difficult to specify *a priori*, but it was fairly easy for a user to critique the generated Tweets and provide feedback on how to improve the summarization process. 

The below pseudo-code shows how you might implement this with the LangGraph memory [store](persistence.md#memory-store), using the store to save a prompt, the `update_instructions` node to get the current prompt (as well as feedback from the conversation with the user captured in `state["messages"]`), update the prompt, and save the new prompt back to the store. Then, the `call_model` get the updated prompt from the store and uses it to generate a response.
