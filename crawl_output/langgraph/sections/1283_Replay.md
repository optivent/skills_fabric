## Replay

It's also possible to play-back a prior graph execution. If we `invoke` a graph with a `thread_id` and a `checkpoint_id`, then we will _re-play_ the previously executed steps _before_ a checkpoint that corresponds to the `checkpoint_id`, and only execute the steps _after_ the checkpoint.

- `thread_id` is the ID of a thread.
- `checkpoint_id` is an identifier that refers to a specific checkpoint within a thread.

You must pass these when invoking the graph as part of the `configurable` portion of the config:

:::python

```python
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1", "checkpoint_id": "0c62ca34-ac19-445d-bbb0-5b4984975b2a"}}
graph.invoke(None, config=config)
```

:::

:::js

```typescript
const config = {
  configurable: {
    thread_id: "1",
    checkpoint_id: "0c62ca34-ac19-445d-bbb0-5b4984975b2a",
  },
};
await graph.invoke(null, config);
```

:::

Importantly, LangGraph knows whether a particular step has been executed previously. If it has, LangGraph simply _re-plays_ that particular step in the graph and does not re-execute the step, but only for the steps _before_ the provided `checkpoint_id`. All of the steps _after_ `checkpoint_id` will be executed (i.e., a new fork), even if they have been executed previously. See this [how to guide on time-travel to learn more about replaying](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/time-travel.md).
