# opencode-shell-strategy
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-shell-strategy#opencode-shell-strategy)
OpenCode instructions for non-interactive shell commands - prevents hangs from TTY-dependent operations.
## Problem
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-shell-strategy#problem)
OpenCode's shell environment is strictly **non-interactive**. It lacks a TTY/PTY, meaning any command that waits for user input, confirmation, or launches a UI (editor/pager) will hang indefinitely and timeout.
Standard AI models often assume a human is watching the terminal or that they can use interactive tools like `nano`, `vim`, or answer "y/n" prompts. In OpenCode's headless environment, these actions cause the agent to hang.
## Solution
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-shell-strategy#solution)
This plugin provides instructions that teach the LLM to:
  * Always use non-interactive flags (e.g., `-y`, `--no-edit`)
  * Bypass prompts using `yes |` or heredocs
  * Avoid TTY-dependent tools (editors, pagers)
  * Prefer OpenCode's native tools (`Read`/`Write`/`Edit`) over shell manipulation


## Installation
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-shell-strategy#installation)
### 1. Clone the repository
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-shell-strategy#1-clone-the-repository)
```
git clone https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-shell-strategy.git ~/.config/opencode/plugin/shell-strategy
```

### 2. Add to OpenCode config
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-shell-strategy#2-add-to-opencode-config)
Add the instruction file to your `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:
```
{
  "instructions": [
    "~/.config/opencode/plugin/shell-strategy/shell_strategy.md"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Restart OpenCode
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-shell-strategy#3-restart-opencode)
The rules will be automatically loaded at the start of every session.
## What It Covers
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-shell-strategy#what-it-covers)
### Package Managers
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-shell-strategy#package-managers)
Tool | Bad (hangs) | Good  
---|---|---  
npm | `npm init` | `npm init -y`  
apt | `apt-get install pkg` | `apt-get install -y pkg`  
pip | `pip install pkg` | `pip install --no-input pkg`  
### Git Operations
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-shell-strategy#git-operations)
Action | Bad (hangs) | Good  
---|---|---  
Commit | `git commit` | `git commit -m "msg"`  
Merge | `git merge branch` | `git merge --no-edit branch`  
Add | `git add -p` | `git add .`  
### System Commands
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-shell-strategy#system-commands)
Tool | Bad (hangs) | Good  
---|---|---  
rm |  `rm file` (prompts) | `rm -f file`  
ssh | `ssh host` | `ssh -o BatchMode=yes host`  
unzip | `unzip file.zip` | `unzip -o file.zip`  
### Banned Commands
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-shell-strategy#banned-commands)
These will always hang - never use them:
  * `vim`, `nano`, `vi` (editors)
  * `less`, `more`, `man` (pagers)
  * `git add -p`, `git rebase -i` (interactive modes)
  * `python` without `-c` flag (REPL)
