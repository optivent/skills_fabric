# Gemini OAuth Plugin for Opencode
[](https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth#gemini-oauth-plugin-for-opencode)
[![License](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fc8f711df463be45cd5273a8c6165f739f906d9fcab18a9fa65548c47cc5c6fc/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6e706d2f6c2f6f70656e636f64652d67656d696e692d61757468)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fc8f711df463be45cd5273a8c6165f739f906d9fcab18a9fa65548c47cc5c6fc/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6e706d2f6c2f6f70656e636f64652d67656d696e692d61757468) [![Version](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0ecc44073a739b4208670fa3f245233fbfd947f49ab3d9740c5730809a292aa9/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6e706d2f762f6f70656e636f64652d67656d696e692d61757468)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0ecc44073a739b4208670fa3f245233fbfd947f49ab3d9740c5730809a292aa9/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6e706d2f762f6f70656e636f64652d67656d696e692d61757468)
**Authenticate the Opencode CLI with your Google account.** This plugin enables you to use your existing Gemini plan and quotas (including the free tier) directly within Opencode, bypassing separate API billing.
## Prerequisites
[](https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth#prerequisites)
  * [Opencode CLI](https://opencode.ai) installed.
  * A Google account with access to Gemini.


## Installation
[](https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth#installation)
Add the plugin to your Opencode configuration file (`~/.config/opencode/config.json` or similar):
```
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-gemini-auth@latest"]
}
```

## Usage
[](https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth#usage)
  1. **Login** : Run the authentication command in your terminal:
```
opencode auth login
```

  2. **Select Provider** : Choose **Google** from the list.
  3. **Authenticate** : Select **OAuth with Google (Gemini CLI)**.
     * A browser window will open for you to approve the access.
     * The plugin spins up a temporary local server to capture the callback.
     * If the local server fails (e.g., port in use or headless environment), you can manually copy/paste the callback URL as instructed.


Once authenticated, Opencode will use your Google account for Gemini requests.
## Configuration
[](https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth#configuration)
### Google Cloud Project
[](https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth#google-cloud-project)
By default, the plugin attempts to provision or find a suitable Google Cloud project. To force a specific project, set the `projectId` in your configuration:
```
{
  "provider": {
    "google": {
      "options": {
        "projectId": "your-specific-project-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Thinking Models
[](https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth#thinking-models)
Configure "thinking" capabilities for Gemini models using the `thinkingConfig` option in your `config.json`.
**Gemini 3 (Thinking Level)** Use `thinkingLevel` (`"low"`, `"high"`) for Gemini 3 models.
```
{
  "provider": {
    "google": {
      "models": {
        "gemini-3-pro-preview": {
          "options": {
            "thinkingConfig": {
              "thinkingLevel": "high",
              "includeThoughts": true
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Gemini 2.5 (Thinking Budget)** Use `thinkingBudget` (token count) for Gemini 2.5 models.
```
{
  "provider": {
    "google": {
      "models": {
        "gemini-2.5-flash": {
          "options": {
            "thinkingConfig": {
              "thinkingBudget": 8192,
              "includeThoughts": true
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting
[](https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth#troubleshooting)
### Manual Google Cloud Setup
[](https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth#manual-google-cloud-setup)
If automatic provisioning fails, you may need to set up the project manually:
  1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  2. Create or select a project.
  3. Enable the **Gemini for Google Cloud API** (`cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com`).
  4. Configure the `projectId` in your Opencode config as shown above.


### Debugging
[](https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth#debugging)
To view detailed logs of Gemini requests and responses, set the `OPENCODE_GEMINI_DEBUG` environment variable:
```
OPENCODE_GEMINI_DEBUG=1 opencode
```

This will generate `gemini-debug-<timestamp>.log` files in your working directory containing sanitized request/response details.
### Updating
[](https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth#updating)
Opencode does not automatically update plugins. To update to the latest version, you must clear the cached plugin:
```
# Clear the specific plugin cache
rm -rf ~/.cache/opencode/node_modules/opencode-gemini-auth

# Run Opencode to trigger a fresh install
opencode
```

## Development
[](https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth#development)
To develop on this plugin locally:
  1. **Clone** :
```
git clone https://github.com/jenslys/opencode-gemini-auth.git
cd opencode-gemini-auth
bun install
```

  2. **Link** : Update your Opencode config to point to your local directory using a `file://` URL:
```
{
  "plugin": ["file:///absolute/path/to/opencode-gemini-auth"]
}
```
