# OpenCode Portal
[](https://github.com/hosenur/portal#opencode-portal)
[![banner](https://github.com/hosenur/portal/raw/main/banner.png)](https://github.com/hosenur/portal/blob/main/banner.png)
> **Disclaimer** : This is a **personal project** and is **not related** to <https://github.com/sst/opencode> or the SST team. This portal is a personal-built interface for interacting with OpenCode instances.
A web-based UI for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), the AI coding agent. This portal provides a browser interface to interact with OpenCode sessions, view messages, and chat with the AI assistant.
## Quick Start
[](https://github.com/hosenur/portal#quick-start)
### Using npx (Recommended)
[](https://github.com/hosenur/portal#using-npx-recommended)
The easiest way to run OpenCode Portal is using npx:
```
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Run OpenCode Portal
npx openportal
```

This will:
  * Start the OpenCode server on port 4000
  * Start the web UI on port 3000
  * Open your browser automatically


### Installation
[](https://github.com/hosenur/portal#installation)
You can also install globally:
```
npm install -g openportal

# Then run in any project directory
openportal
```

### CLI Options
[](https://github.com/hosenur/portal#cli-options)
```
openportal [options]

Options:
  -V, --version           output the version number
  -p, --port <port>       Port for web UI (default: "3000")
  --opencode-port <port>  Port for OpenCode server (default: "4000")
  -d, --directory <path>  Working directory for OpenCode
  --no-browser            Do not open browser automatically
  --skip-opencode-check   Skip OpenCode installation check
  -h, --help              display help for command
```

### Prerequisites
[](https://github.com/hosenur/portal#prerequisites)
OpenCode must be installed on your system. Install it using one of these methods:
```
# Using curl (macOS/Linux)
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash

# Using npm
npm install -g opencode

# Using Homebrew (macOS)
brew install sst/tap/opencode
```

## Overview
[](https://github.com/hosenur/portal#overview)
OpenCode Portal connects to a running OpenCode server and provides:
  * Session management (create, view, delete sessions)
  * Real-time chat interface with the AI assistant
  * File mention support (`@filename` to reference files)
  * Model selection
  * Dark/light theme support


## Why This Project?
[](https://github.com/hosenur/portal#why-this-project)
OpenCode comes with its own official web UI that you can access by running:
```
opencode --port 4096
```

However, the official UI is **currently under development** and has some limitations:
  * Not mobile responsive
  * Limited mobile experience


This project was inspired by my personal need to access OpenCode from my mobile device when I don't have my laptop around. The goal is to provide a mobile-first, responsive interface for interacting with OpenCode instances remotely.
## Use Case
[](https://github.com/hosenur/portal#use-case)
This portal is designed for remote access to your OpenCode instance. Deploy the portal on a VPS alongside OpenCode, then use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) (or similar VPN) to securely connect from your mobile device or any other machine.
**Example setup:**
```
[Your Phone] ---(Tailscale)---> [VPS running Portal + OpenCode]

```
