# opencode-morph-fast-apply
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-morph-fast-apply#opencode-morph-fast-apply)
OpenCode plugin for [Morph Fast Apply](https://morphllm.com) - 10x faster code editing with lazy edit markers.
## Features
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-morph-fast-apply#features)
  * **10,500+ tokens/sec** code editing via Morph's Fast Apply API
  * **Lazy edit markers** (`// ... existing code ...`) - no exact string matching needed
  * **Unified diff output** with context for easy review
  * **Graceful fallback** - suggests native `edit` tool on API failure


## Installation
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-morph-fast-apply#installation)
### 1. Clone the repository
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-morph-fast-apply#1-clone-the-repository)
```
git clone https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-morph-fast-apply.git ~/dev/oc-plugins/morph-fast-apply
cd ~/dev/oc-plugins/morph-fast-apply
npm install
```

### 2. Set your Morph API key
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-morph-fast-apply#2-set-your-morph-api-key)
Get an API key at [morphllm.com/dashboard](https://morphllm.com/dashboard/api-keys), then add to your shell profile:
```
export MORPH_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
```

### 3. Add the plugin to your OpenCode config
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-morph-fast-apply#3-add-the-plugin-to-your-opencode-config)
Add to your global config (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`):
```
{
  "plugin": [
    "/path/to/morph-fast-apply"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "/path/to/morph-fast-apply/MORPH_INSTRUCTIONS.md"
  ]
}
```

Or in a project-local `.opencode/config.json`:
```
{
  "plugin": [
    "~/dev/oc-plugins/morph-fast-apply"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "~/dev/oc-plugins/morph-fast-apply/MORPH_INSTRUCTIONS.md"
  ]
}
```

### 4. Restart OpenCode
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-morph-fast-apply#4-restart-opencode)
The `morph_edit` tool will now be available.
## Usage
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-morph-fast-apply#usage)
The LLM can use `morph_edit` for efficient partial file edits:
```
morph_edit({
  target_filepath: "src/auth.ts",
  instructions: "Add error handling for invalid tokens",
  code_edit: `// ... existing code ...
function validateToken(token) {
  if (!token) {
    throw new Error("Token is required");
  }
  // ... existing code ...
}
// ... existing code ...`
})

```

### When to use `morph_edit` vs `edit`
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-morph-fast-apply#when-to-use-morph_edit-vs-edit)
Situation | Tool | Reason  
---|---|---  
Small, exact replacement | `edit` | Fast, no API call  
Large file (500+ lines) | `morph_edit` | Handles partial snippets  
Multiple scattered changes | `morph_edit` | Batch efficiently  
Whitespace-sensitive | `morph_edit` | Forgiving with formatting  
## Configuration
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-morph-fast-apply#configuration)
Variable | Default | Description  
---|---|---  
`MORPH_API_KEY` | (required) | Your Morph API key  
`MORPH_API_URL` | `https://api.morphllm.com` | API endpoint  
`MORPH_MODEL` | `morph-v3-fast` | Model (`morph-v3-fast`, `morph-v3-large`, `auto`)  
`MORPH_TIMEOUT` | `30000` | Request timeout in ms  
## How It Works
[](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-morph-fast-apply#how-it-works)
  1. Reads the original file content
  2. Sends `<instruction>`, `<code>`, and `<update>` to Morph API
  3. Morph intelligently merges the lazy edit markers with original code
  4. Writes the merged result back to the file
  5. Returns a unified diff showing what changed
