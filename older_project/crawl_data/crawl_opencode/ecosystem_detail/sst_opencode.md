### Installation
[](https://github.com/sst/opencode#installation)
```
# YOLO
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash

# Package managers
npm i -g opencode-ai@latest        # or bun/pnpm/yarn
scoop bucket add extras; scoop install extras/opencode  # Windows
choco install opencode             # Windows
brew install opencode              # macOS and Linux
paru -S opencode-bin               # Arch Linux
mise use -g github:sst/opencode # Any OS
nix run nixpkgs#opencode           # or github:sst/opencode for latest dev branch
```

Remove versions older than 0.1.x before installing.
### Desktop App (BETA)
[](https://github.com/sst/opencode#desktop-app-beta)
OpenCode is also available as a desktop application. Download directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/sst/opencode/releases) or [opencode.ai/download](https://opencode.ai/download).
Platform | Download  
---|---  
macOS (Apple Silicon) | `opencode-desktop-darwin-aarch64.dmg`  
macOS (Intel) | `opencode-desktop-darwin-x64.dmg`  
Windows | `opencode-desktop-windows-x64.exe`  
Linux |  `.deb`, `.rpm`, or AppImage  
```
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install --cask opencode-desktop
```

#### Installation Directory
[](https://github.com/sst/opencode#installation-directory)
The install script respects the following priority order for the installation path:
  1. `$OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR` - Custom installation directory
  2. `$XDG_BIN_DIR` - XDG Base Directory Specification compliant path
  3. `$HOME/bin` - Standard user binary directory (if exists or can be created)
  4. `$HOME/.opencode/bin` - Default fallback


```
# Examples
OPENCODE_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
XDG_BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

### Agents
[](https://github.com/sst/opencode#agents)
OpenCode includes two built-in agents you can switch between, you can switch between these using the `Tab` key.
  * **build** - Default, full access agent for development work
  * **plan** - Read-only agent for analysis and code exploration 
    * Denies file edits by default
    * Asks permission before running bash commands
    * Ideal for exploring unfamiliar codebases or planning changes


Also, included is a **general** subagent for complex searches and multistep tasks. This is used internally and can be invoked using `@general` in messages.
Learn more about [agents](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents).
### Documentation
[](https://github.com/sst/opencode#documentation)
For more info on how to configure OpenCode [**head over to our docs**](https://opencode.ai/docs).
### Contributing
[](https://github.com/sst/opencode#contributing)
If you're interested in contributing to OpenCode, please read our [contributing docs](https://github.com/sst/opencode/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request.
### Building on OpenCode
[](https://github.com/sst/opencode#building-on-opencode)
If you are working on a project that's related to OpenCode and is using "opencode" as a part of its name; for example, "opencode-dashboard" or "opencode-mobile", please add a note to your README to clarify that it is not built by the OpenCode team and is not affiliated with us in any way.
### FAQ
[](https://github.com/sst/opencode#faq)
#### How is this different from Claude Code?
[](https://github.com/sst/opencode#how-is-this-different-from-claude-code)
It's very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:
  * 100% open source
  * Not coupled to any provider. Although we recommend the models we provide through [OpenCode Zen](https://opencode.ai/zen); OpenCode can be used with Claude, OpenAI, Google or even local models. As models evolve the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop so being provider-agnostic is important.
  * Out of the box LSP support
  * A focus on TUI. OpenCode is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what's possible in the terminal.
  * A client/server architecture. This for example can allow OpenCode to run on your computer, while you can drive it remotely from a mobile app. Meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.


#### What's the other repo?
[](https://github.com/sst/opencode#whats-the-other-repo)
The other confusingly named repo has no relation to this one. You can [read the story behind it here](https://x.com/thdxr/status/1933561254481666466).
