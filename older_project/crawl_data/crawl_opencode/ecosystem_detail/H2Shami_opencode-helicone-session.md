# opencode-helicone-session
[](https://github.com/H2Shami/opencode-helicone-session#opencode-helicone-session)
An OpenCode plugin that automatically injects Helicone session headers into your LLM requests. This groups all requests from the same OpenCode session together in Helicone's dashboard.
## Installation
[](https://github.com/H2Shami/opencode-helicone-session#installation)
```
npm install -g opencode-helicone-session
# or
bun add -g opencode-helicone-session
```

## Usage
[](https://github.com/H2Shami/opencode-helicone-session#usage)
Add the plugin to your `opencode.json`:
```
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-helicone-session"],
}
```

That's it! The plugin will automatically add:
  * `Helicone-Session-Id` - A consistent UUID derived from the OpenCode session ID
  * `Helicone-Session-Name` - The session title


## How It Works
[](https://github.com/H2Shami/opencode-helicone-session#how-it-works)
  1. The plugin listens for OpenCode session events (`session.created`, `session.updated`)
  2. On each LLM request, it injects the session headers via a custom fetch wrapper
  3. All requests in the same session are grouped together in Helicone


## Custom Headers
[](https://github.com/H2Shami/opencode-helicone-session#custom-headers)
If you specify your own `Helicone-Session-Id` or `Helicone-Session-Name` in your config, the plugin will not overwrite them.
## Requirements
[](https://github.com/H2Shami/opencode-helicone-session#requirements)
  * OpenCode v0.15.0 or later
  * A Helicone account


## License
[](https://github.com/H2Shami/opencode-helicone-session#license)
