## Project Security and Vulnerability Reporting
The Loguru project maintains a clear security policy, detailed in [`.github/SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/delgan/loguru/blob/36da8cca14457f6e1d1bbca25fb29ba42b2d70cb/.github/SECURITY.md), to address vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity of the library. This policy outlines supported versions and the procedure for reporting potential security issues.
### Supported Versions and Patching Policy
Only the latest major version of Loguru receives security patches. Older versions are generally not retroactively patched. This approach ensures that development resources are focused on maintaining the security of the most current release, as described in [Supported Versions and Patching Policy](https://codewiki.google/github.com/Delgan/loguru#project-security-and-vulnerability-reporting-supported-versions-and-patching-policy).
### Vulnerability Reporting Process
To report a security vulnerability, individuals are directed to email [`delgan.py@gmail.com`](https://github.com/delgan/loguru/blob/36da8cca14457f6e1d1bbca25fb29ba42b2d70cb/pyproject.toml#L6). The report should include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, a list of affected Loguru versions, and any known mitigations. Upon confirmation, the project team will either fix the vulnerability directly or document mitigating solutions within the "Security considerations when using Loguru" section of the official documentation, as further detailed in [Vulnerability Reporting Process](https://codewiki.google/github.com/Delgan/loguru#project-security-and-vulnerability-reporting-vulnerability-reporting-process). The [`.github`](https://github.com/delgan/loguru/blob/36da8cca14457f6e1d1bbca25fb29ba42b2d70cb/.github) directory contains the relevant policies and procedures for handling such reports.
### Supported Versions and Patching Policy
The Loguru project's security policy, as outlined in [`.github/SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/delgan/loguru/blob/36da8cca14457f6e1d1bbca25fb29ba42b2d70cb/.github/SECURITY.md), specifies that security patches are provided only for the latest major version of the library. Older versions typically do not receive retroactive patches. This approach centralizes security efforts on the most current stable release, ensuring that users leveraging the latest features also benefit from ongoing security maintenance.
